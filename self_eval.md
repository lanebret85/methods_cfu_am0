# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I'm most proud of the comfort I'm feeling with methods, both built-in and custom ones. As I've gone, I've been able to see how we might be able to combine the topics we've learned and fully automate processes. For example, I expect we'll be able to use iteration to add and/or manipulate elements in an array without having to write out a separate line of code for each command. The thought of being able to work that efficiently and the real-world applications that come with it are exciting.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

I guess I jumped ahead a little bit, but the power of using methods is that we'll be able to execute specific actions multiple times with a lot less code than if we were to code out the action each individual time.
